# Description
This is a proof of concept of the Pi Camera taking video on top of the microscope viewing lens, which allow for higher magnification that if I had to remove it.
Note that the colors and sharpness is well of as the Pi Camera still has the plastic film protecting the lens.
The code is based on the (Pi Learning Resources)[https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/getting-started-with-picamera/worksheet/]
